        <br><br>
        <p>
            The BMW 801 was a powerful German 41.8-litre (2,550 cu in) air-cooled 14-cylinder-radial aircraft engine built by BMW and used in a number of German Luftwaffe aircraft of World War II. Production versions of the twin-row engine generated between 1,560 and 2,000 PS (1,540–1,970 hp, or 1,150–1,470 kW). It was the most produced radial engine of Germany in World War II with more than 61,000 built.

            The 801 was originally intended to replace existing radial types in German transport and utility aircraft. At the time, it was widely agreed among European designers[citation needed] that an inline engine was a requirement for high performance designs due to its smaller frontal area and resulting lower drag. Kurt Tank successfully fitted a BMW 801 to a new fighter design he was working on, and as a result the 801 became best known as the power plant for the famous Focke-Wulf Fw 190. The BMW 801 radial also pioneered the use of what would today be designated an engine control unit: its Kommandogerät engine management system took over the operation of several aviation engine management control parameters of the era, allowing proper operation of the engine with just one throttle lever.

BMW began manufacturing cars in 1928 after purchasing Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, a company that built Austin Sevens under license from Dixi. The BMW 3/15 was produced from July 1929 to March 1932. 
 
                BMW's first small car was built under license from the Austin Motor Company in 1929, but was replaced by BMW's own designs in 1932.</p>

                In the late 1970s, Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini entered into an agreement with BMW to build a production racing car in sufficient quantity for homologation, but conflicts arose that prompted BMW to produce the car themselves. The resulting car was sold to the public, from 1978 until 1981, as the BMW M1.</p>
